# FestivalWatch
Music festivals have gained remarkable popularity over the years, but the Covid-19 pandemic 
imposed a sudden change, resulting in the cancellation or postponement of many of these 
events. However, with the relaxation of restrictions, a swift resumption of these events has 
been observed, both locally and internationally, offering a broad variety of festivals covering 
diverse musical genres for all music fans. Furthermore, the technological advancements and 
the introduction of Android and iOS devices in the market have had a significant impact on 
the way festivals are managed and organized. The multitude of applications and features they 
offer to users has facilitated interaction with social media and offered new opportunities for 
organizers and participants.
The main objective of this thesis is to propose a platform that provides users with the ability 
to access important information related to the organization of a festival, as well as the 
possibility to purchase tickets through online transactions with a bank card. Additionally, the 
application offers organizers the ability to plan a music festival by filling out certain fields with 
the necessary data and updating it with new information in order to facilitate good 
organization and adaptability to the needs of the public.

The frontend of the application is developed using the Android platform, in Kotlin, 
while the backend is built with Django framework.

FestivalSee has the following functionalities:

• Authentication:
This is intended to allow the creation of a user account within the application, ensuring a 
personalized experience and can help build a community.

• Login:
This functionality allows access to the account created at the Authentication step, 
thus the user can access the data he needs, especially those related to the payment made for a certain festival.

• Profile:
The user can always view data related to his profile, as well as modify it at will. 
This information is essential for identifying each user within this platform, while also providing 
the possibility of personalization and control over personal information.

In this section, users can view all the festivals available in the FestivalSee application. 
Each festival is listed individually, allowing easy and quick navigation between different events.

Users can find out important dates, such as: event date, time, description, photos, etc. This allows efficient preparation

• Viewing the map:
Each festival has a location on the map, through which the user can figure out the distance to travel to the event. 
This function can be useful in planning the journey and estimating the necessary travel time.

• Purchasing a ticket:
Through this functionality, the user can purchase a ticket for the festival he wants to attend, using a bank card. 
This process is simple and efficient, reducing the need to navigate on various sites or to stand in long queues for purchasing physical tickets.

• Adding a festival:
This feature is intended for organizers who want to introduce a new festival through the platform. 
They can provide the necessary data such as: name, date, time, description, images, payment details or location, and others.

• Adding an organizer:
This functionality allows adding organizer rights for a user within the application, thus he can introduce or modify festivals.

• Modifying a festival:
As the description suggests, this functionality allows access to data related to a searched festival, 
with the purpose of updating them in case necessary changes appear. This ensures that the information is always up-to-date, 
helping users stay current with the latest details about events. This can include changes to the schedule or any other relevant aspects.
